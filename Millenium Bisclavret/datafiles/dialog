SHC Officer: Hold up, Mel. B. 
SHC Officer: You've been selected for a occupational compliance and safety inspection. 
Melion Bisclavret: Please move. 
SHC Officer: Don't be so cold hearted, Mel. B. S'just protocol.
Melion Bisclavret: I really, *really* do not have time for this.
SHC Officer: That's what you said last week. 
SHC Officer: Hey, someone's gotta be concerned for well-being. 
SHC Officer: Might as well be me. We're here to make sure that blade of yours is up to code.
Melion Bisclavret: Who is "We"? It's always just you.
SHC Officer: I'm loyal like that.
SHC Officer: There's quite a commotion on the upper floors. Seems everyone's brandishing something or other. It's like they're preparing for war.
SHC Officer: So I rushed down here. Us little guys oughta' stick together, huh?
Melion Bisclavret: No.
SHC Officer: Hey now.
