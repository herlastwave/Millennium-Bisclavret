Melion Bisclavret: Let me through, Renée. I need to–
Renée Allard: I know exactly what you need, Bisclavret, but I cannot allow it.
Renée Allard: You will not take more step towards that elevator.
Renée Allard: You will return to your desk, pick up your phone, 
Renée Allard: and inform Mr. Tweed that you politely decline his offer and that Ms. Allard should be reinstated.
Melion Bisclavret: Renée, please–
Renée Allard: You will never have this role, Bisclavret. You aren't cut out for it. Not this century.
Renée Allard: Look around. Look at your clothes. It's like you can't even tell what year it is.
-> What's wrong with my clothes?
    Melion Bisclavret: W–

Renée Allard: You are an anachronism. This whole company is an anachronism. It's time for all of us to grow up.
Melion Bisclavret: That's not–
Renée Allard: You barely know how to send email. Poor LeThèque from IT booby trapped the printer to stop you from trying to 'fix' it.
Renée Allard: Face it, Bisclavret. *Someone* is trying to drag this place kicking and screaming into the new millennium.

Renée Allard: I suppose it was all for nothing, then. This place will never change.

Renée Allard: If I have to get my hands dirty to salvage that on my way out, so be it.

[Press 'Z' or 'SPACE' to begin.]

Once upon a time,
Back when foxes played polo,
And tigers used to smoke tobacco,
(Or wait, don't they still do that?)
There was a man named Melion.
Melion was a faithful servant to his lord.
He toiled each day in his lord's service.
His was a meager existence without recognition.
But one day, he recieved a message from above.
"Hey! Is this um... Melion Bisclavret?"
Melion Bisclavret: "This is he."
"Great! This is Marie-Luce, I'm calling from Mr. Tweed's office."
Marie-Luce: "Congratulations! You've been selected for a promotion to general manager."
Melion Bisclavret: "G–"
Marie-Luce: "If you could come up to sign a few papers to finalize the decision. You know, standard protocol."
-> Of course!
    Melion Bisclavret: "Right, of course."
-> Not yet...
    Melion Bisclavret: "I need time to think about it."
Marie-Luce: "Well, be quick about it please! Mr. Tweed is a very busy man."
Melion Bisclavret: "Understood. I'll be there promptly."
Marie-Luce: "But if you'd like to celebrate a little with your co-workers on the way up, I won't stop you.
Marie-Luce: "I'm sure everyone'll want to congratulate you on the big accomplishment!"
-> Absolutely.
    Melion Bisclavret: "Sure, but am I not the first to hear of this?"
-> Absolutely not.
    Melion Bisclavret: "Uh... right. But you're saying I'm not the first to hear of this?"
Marie-Luce: "Well, not exactly. Gaurin found out and he's a bit of a gossip."
Melion Bisclavret:"Gaurin!?"
Marie-Luce: "Ha ha, you know him? He's–"
Melion Bisclavret: "I'll be right there. Goodbye."

    SHC Officer: Hold up, Mel. B. 
    SHC Officer: You've been randomly selected for an occupational compliance and safety inspection. 
    Melion Bisclavret: Please move. 
    SHC Officer: Don't be so cold hearted, Mel. B. S'just protocol.
    Melion Bisclavret: I really, *really* do not have time for this.
    SHC Officer: That's what you said last week. 
    SHC Officer: Someone's gotta be concerned for your well-being. 
    SHC Officer: Might as well be me. We're here to make sure that blade of yours is up to code.
    Melion Bisclavret: Who is 'we'? It's always just you.
    SHC Officer: I'm loyal like that.
    SHC Officer: There's quite a commotion on the upper floors. Seems everyone's brandishing something or other. It's like they're preparing for war.
    SHC Officer: So I rushed down here. Us little guys oughta' stick together, huh?
    -> Yes.
        Melion Bisclavret: Sure.
        SHC Officer: Right on, Mel. B.
    -> No.
        Melion Bisclavret: No.
        SHC Officer: Agree to disagree, Mel. B. 
    SHC Officer: Anyway, would you like to start a brief safety training refresher?
    -> No.
        Melion Bisclavret: No.
    -> No.
        Melion Bisclavret: No.
    SHC Officer: Too bad. 'S mandatory.  
    SHC Officer: If you find yourself in a duel with a fellow employee, try to resolve the situation through dialogue. It might not always work out the way you expect, though.
    SHC Officer: Getting into the headspace of your opponent can give you hints about their next move. If they seem focused on you, it could mean an attack is imminent.
    SHC Officer: In that case, ready yourself and prepare to block. But if they seem distracted, take it as a sign to strike.
    SHC Officer: Hypothetically speaking, of course. You should always resolve conflicts non-violently.
    SHC Officer: Anyway, it looks like your sword is up to code. I'll get out of your way now.
    <<set $safetyIsCollidable = 0 >>
    Melion Bisclavret: Thank the lord.
    SHC Officer: Buuuuut if you have any more questions, you can always come back to me for help. Your saftey is our number one priority.

    SHC Officer: You're back for more tips? 
    SHC Officer: I got a whole booklet of em right here. You can have it, they give us extras at the branch HQ.
    Bisclavret reluctatntly obtained a copy of 'Clarification of SHC1910.212 and SHC1910.242, as applying to hand-type office paper cutters and sharp edged hand tools'.
    Bisclavret discretely disposed of the booklet in a nearby waste bin.
    << set $gotBooklet = 1>>

        An unknown force compels Bisclavret on this pointless errand.
        Melion Bisclavret: Is the SHC going paperless?
        SHC Officer: Not that I heard, Mel. B. 
        SHC Officer: But if we are, I'll be sure to hand em all off to you.
        Melion Bisclavret: Lovely.
        << set $gotBooklet = 3>>
    <<endif>>
    SHC Officer: Sorry, Mel. B. I'm out of pamphlets. I'll have more for you next week.

    SHC Officer: I'll just randomly select you again? Simple as.

    Eugène: Nah. Allard's just a product manager. Not much real power in that role.
    Eugène: It was the higher ups. Market's down right now. 
    Eugène: 'Downsizing'.
    Melion Bisclavret: Hm. I'm sure Renée didn't lift a finger to stop it, though.
    Eugène: Don't be unfair, Melion. It ain't personal.
    Eugène: 'Sides, I heard you're her boss now. She ain't gonna be thrilled.
    Melion Bisclavret: I still need to sign the papers in Tweed's office.
    Eugène: Mhm. Good luck getting there. Allard is already guarding the elevator.
    -> What about the stairs?
        Eugène: One of the execs greased em up. Scary guy wearing a brass mask.
        Melion Bisclavret: Gaurin... 
        Eugène: Oh, and someone else rigged up a bunch of booby traps. Tripwires, swinging blades, buzzsaws, the works.
        Eugène: Just like the ones in front of the printer. Seems like a fire hazard to me.
    -> No other way but through.
        Eugène: Not since that masked guy greased the stairs. One of the execs, I think.
        Melion Bisclavret: Gaurin... That's uncharacteristically tame for him.
        Eugène: I think it's just a distraction from booby traps. You know, tripwires, swinging blades, buzzsaws, the works.
        Eugène: Like the ones in front of the printer. Seems like a fire hazard to me.
    Melion Bisclavret: So I'll have to get past Renée...

Alix LeThéque: I fix your information systems and engineer deterrences to your behavior.
Melion Bislcavret: Have you ever considered that you might be the problem?
Alix LeThéque: I have thoroughly considered every possibility. I briefly considered the idea that I'm already dead, and this is my eternal punishment for sins unrepented.
Alix LeThéque: But the P-value on that one is pretty low, all things considered.

Alix LeThéque: You cannot fool me, Melion Bislcavret. It isn't that simple.
Alix LeThéque: You cannot be trusted with authority over the administrative system. You will infect the whole company with your incompetence.

Melion Bislcavret: Fine then. If that's how it's got to be.
Alix LeThéque: With the powers and duties vested in me by the office of integrated technology...
Alix LeThéque: I challenge you, Melion Bislcavret!
Alix LeThéque: En garde!

Alix LeThéque: Are you trying to run away? In this four square meter box?
Alix LeThéque: There's nowhere to go! 
The control panel is completely fortified behind LeThéque's stance.
The only way to reach it is to break her posture, somehow.
(Which means fighting... Well, it was worth a shot anyways.)
Melion Bislcavret: I guess I didn't think this one through.
Alix LeThéque: I don't believe you've ever thought *anything* through, sir.
Alix LeThéque: En garde!

    The Receptionist: Hi! Welcome to the executive suite!!
    Melion Bisclavret: Good morning.
    The Receptionist: You must be Mr. Bisclavret, we spoke earlier on the phone! I'm Marie-Luce!!
    Melion Bisclavret: You seemed less, uh, animated on the phone.
    Marie-Luce: I hadn't had my coffee yet!
    Marie-Luce: 'I'm not me before I've had my coffee'!!
    Melion Bisclavret: Me either.
    Marie-Luce: Let me know if you have any questions about the suite! Or anything else! 
    <<set $dancerVisited=1>>

    Marie-Luce: Mr. Bisclavret, did you have any questions about the executive suite!? 
    -> The boss's office...
        Melion Bisclavret: Where is Tweed's office?
        Marie-Luce: Just down the hall! You can't miss it!!
        Marie-Luce: 
    -> Gaurin...
        Melion Bisclavret: You mentioned Gaurin on the phone. 
        Marie-Luce: Ha ha! You know him, right? What a character! 
        Melion Bisclavret: We've met. 
        Melion Bisclavret: ...He isn't still here, is he?
        Marie-Luce: Mmmmmmmmm, maybe? He's probably in Mr. Tweed's office. 
        Marie-Luce: You know, being his assistant and all.
        Melion Bisclavret: Hooray. No way around it, then.
        Marie-Luce: Say hi to him for me, please!!

    Bisclavret peeks back through the elevator doors.
    LeThéque is fidgeting with her pager. It looks like she's trying to send a message to someone.
    -> Confront.
        Melion Bislcavret: What are you doing?
        Alix LeThéque: AAAAAAAAAGH!!
        Alix LeThéque: Why are you still here? I thought you left!
        Melion Bislcavret: Nope. Still here.
        Alix LeThéque: What does it look like I'm doing?
        Melion Bislcavret: I don't know, that's why I'm asking. 
        Alix LeThéque: Well, it's none of your business!
        -> Persist.
            Melion Bislcavret: ...
            Bislcavret hears LeThéque muttering under her breath as she punches codes into the tiny device on her hip.
            Alix LeThéque: (10... 33...)
            Alix LeThéque: (A... 10... 7... L... 10... 7...)

    -> Do not.
    Melion Bislcavret: I've got better things to do.
    Alix LeThéque: ??????
    Alix LeThéque: You're still here!?
    Melion Bislcavret: No.

    Telephoner: Hello!
    Melion Bisclavret: Good morning.
    Telephoner: Hello?
    Melion Bisclavret: Uh, hi.
    Telephoner: Hello? Hello!?
    Melion Bisclavret: Um. Are you–
    Telephoner: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm on the phone, you see.
    Melion Bisclavret: Uh huh. Why are out you in the hallway?
    Telephoner: The reception in my office is terrible. I always take calls out here.
    Melion Bisclavret: On a landline?
    Melion Bisclavret: Well, don't let me disturb you.
    Telephoner: It's no matter. The line is dead, anyway.
    Melion Bisclavret: Weird.
    Telephoner: I know, right? It happened just as you were walking over.
    Telephoner: The voice got all garbled up and suddenly cut out... just like in my office.
    -> Sounds spooky.
        Melion Bisclavret: Creepy stuff. I wonder why.
        Telephoner: Me too. I'm not superstitious though, I think it's something electrical. Something in the wiring.
    -> Sounds stupid.
        Melion Bisclavret: Probably a coincidence. 
        Telephoner: I'm not so sure. I think its some kind of electrical interference. 
        Telephoner: Have you ever been talking on the cordless while using the microwave? 
        Melion Bisclavret: I don't own a microwave.
        Telephoner: Really? They're awfully convenient. How do you manage without one?
        Melion Bisclavret: I'm on a raw-food diet.
    Telephoner: I've submitted dozens of service requests, but IT hasn't been able to fix it.
    Telephoner: They said something about 'anomalous interference' coming from one of the lower floors.
    Telephoner: You're the new promotee from down there, right? Bisclavret?
    Melion Bisclavret: At your service.
    Telephoner: Do you know anything about the anomaly down there?
    -> Of course.
        Melion Bisclavret: The science of probability means nothing, down there.
        Melion Bisclavret: Flip a coin a dozen times and you'll see a dozen tails.
        Melion Bisclavret: A single man can be 'randomly selected' sixteen weeks in a row.
        Telephoner: Nothing about technology, though?
    -> Not really.
        Melion Bisclavret: Nope. Everything is perfectly normal.
        Telephoner: Nothing at all?
    Melion Bisclavret: Well, our printer doesn't work anymore.
    Telephoner: That's not much of an anomaly.
    Telephoner: Anyway, I asked one of the IT people about my phone problem when she walked past earlier today...
    Telephoner: She shook her head and said she was on her way to deal with it 'for good',
    Telephoner: but clearly, it isn't fixed!
    Melion Bisclavret: That's IT for you. Lazy bastards.
